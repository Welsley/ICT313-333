========================

W.A.R.I.S (Augmented Reality)

Archive for a university group project. It is an augmented reality program for android phones. It is a proof of concept. The concept is for the program to recognize where you are looking based on direction of the phone's camera and display information of the building. It works with an internal map and a database of the information of the buildings in the area. For limiting our scope, we chose to use parts of the university campus as the area's borders. Information includes staff rooms, availability of lecture halls, etc.

Controls are via a controller attached to the phone via an adapter.
